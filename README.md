# Cybersecurity-Creating-an-algorithm-for-file-updates-in-python
In this project we will create an algorithm that will allow us to update an ‘allow list’ of IP addresses by removing undesired IP’s using python. To accomplish this the file will be converted into a format that python can use. Then elements will be removed from the file and these changes will be written to the original file.
